# Advent of Code 2017

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2017.  I've really
enjoyed a break from real world problems to work on something more
algorithm-focused.

**Disclaimer:**

The solutions included here are hacky by their very nature.  My goal
was **not** to write the most efficient or maintainable code.  Instead
I focused on writing quick and dirty code for a specific purpose.
That's why it's fun and why it's ugly :).
